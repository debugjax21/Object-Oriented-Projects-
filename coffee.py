"""
This is an object-oriented design projcet that simulates a vending machine that dispenses different types
of (old-fashioned) coffee as well as chicken bouillon.
The program can either be ran from the shell by calling Main() or through the command line.

Things I learned: I learned more about classes, how they work and how I can fit them together to make a whole,
a.k.a the coffee machine. I also learned how to write my program to have a tighter control on how it runs
so that if the user inputs something incorrectly the program doesn't crash.
